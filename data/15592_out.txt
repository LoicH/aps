Clarification on the use of HEVC BLA and CRA Pictures 

Eric Nassor 

Introduction 

1 
HEVC defines several types of random access pictures (RAP). These pictures are used in diverse 
ISO  standards,  in  particular  the  HEVC  File  Format,  the  Image  File  Format  and  DASH,  not 
always in a similar manner. This contribution reviews the different types of RAP and proposes to 
harmonize their signaling. 

2  Analysis of HEVC RAP types 
HEVC defines different IRAP Pictures as follows: 
"An IRAP picture contains only I slices, and may be a BLA picture, a CRA picture or an IDR picture" 
and 
"Provided the necessary parameter sets are available when they need to be activated, the IRAP picture and all subsequent non-
RASL pictures in decoding order can be correctly decoded without performing the decoding process of any pictures that precede 
the IRAP picture in decoding order." 
 
Non-IRAP pictures include Leading Pictures and Trailing Pictures. 
 
There are 6 types of NALU to indicate the type of RAP: 

IDR_N_LP  
IDR_W_RADL  

 
 
  BLA_W_LP  
  BLA_W_RADL  
  BLA_N_LP  
  CRA_NUT 

 
IDR_N_LP have 3 characteristics: 1) they are RAP; 2) they reset the reference list (i.e. no frame 
after in decoding order will need frames before the IDR); and 3) they do not have associated 
leading pictures (there is no frame after in decoding order that will have to be presented before).  
 
BLA_N_LP are similar to IDR_N_LP with the difference that they do not reset the reference list. 
Some frames after in decoding order may not be decodable if the decoding starts at this BLA 
because the reference list is not empty.  
 

 

 

IDR_W_RADL are RAP that reset the reference list. So, all frames after this IDR in decoding 
order can be decoded if the decoding starts from the IDR. It may have leading picture, but these 
leading pictures (if they exist) are decodable.  
 
BLA_W_RADL are similar to IDR_W_RADL, but the reference list is specified in the NAL unit 
header.  
 
BLA_W_LP are BLA_W_RADL but additionally that there may be associated LP that cannot be 
decoded.  
 
CRA_NUT are BLA pictures for which the exact BLA type has not been indicated. 
 
CRA Pictures (and therefore BLA) are typically used in Open GoP structures as they provide 
RAP but allow for a reference list that contains pictures before the BLA or CRA and therefore 
enables a better coding efficiency. When starting with such frame a compliant HEVC decoder 
should follow a procedure to discard frames that cannot be decoded.  
 
Typically, an encoder, when using Open GoP structures, will produce CRA pictures. A decoder 
when tuning in at this point (when starting to decode from the CRA) is forced to discard frames 
that have references not yet there. The problem happens when this CRA is spliced with another 
bitstream as it will not be the first frame anymore. Decoders will be able to find some reference 
frames, but possibly wrong ones. It is the role of a splicing tool to signal a BLA picture instead 
of the CRA picture, with a proper type depending on the use of LP. Decoders will then discard 
RASL. 
 
The HEVC standard defines IDR and BLA pictures using "may", which means that an encoder 
or  a  packager  may  signal  an  IDR  of  type  IDR_W_RADL  when  in  fact  there  are  no  RADL. 
Signaling in File Formats is dependent on the encoder and on the work done at the file packager, 
i.e.  whether  it  relied  on  the  encoder  output  or  whether  it  analyzed  the  frames  to  set  a  stricter 
NALU  type.  For  the  sake  of  simplicity,  we  assume  that  the  encoder  uses  the  strictest  possible 
NALU types. It does not for instance signal BLA_W_RADL when it is actually BLA_N_LP or 
other cases. 

3  Mapping of HEVC RAP Types to ISOBMFF, DASH and IFF 
14496-12 5th edition defines the following term: 
"3.1.11 random access point (RAP)  
sample in a track that starts at the ISAU of a SAP of type 1 or 2 or 3 as defined in Annex I; informally, a 
sample,  from  which  when  decoding  starts,  the  sample  itself  and  all  samples  following  in  composition 
order can be correctly decoded" 
 
This matches all types of HEVC RAP. 
 
"3.1.16 sync sample  
sample in a track that starts at the ISAU of a SAP of type 1 or 2 as defined in Annex I; informally, a media 
sample that starts a new independent sequence of samples; if decoding starts at the sync sample, it and 
succeeding  samples  in  decoding  order  can  all  be  correctly  decoded,  and  the  resulting  set  of  decoded 
samples forms the correct presentation of the media starting at the decoded sample that has the earliest 
composition time; a media format may provide a more precise definition of a sync sample for that format" 
 
We  believe  that  for  HEVC  this  definition  also  matches  only  IDR_N_LP,  IDR_W_RADL, 
BLA_N_LP and BLA_W_RADL. 

 

 

 
14496-12 5th edition defines "leading sample" as follows: 
"A leading sample is such a sample associated with an “open” random access point (RAP). It  precedes the RAP in 
presentation order and immediate follows the RAP or another leading sample in decoding order, and when decoding 
starts from the RAP, the sample cannot be correctly decoded." 
 
This  definition  (which should  be placed in  the terms and definition  section) is  equivalent  to  an 
HEVC RASL. 
 
14496-12 5th edition defines RAP sample grouping as follows: 
"A sync sample is specified to be a random access point after which all samples in decoding order can be 
correctly decoded. However, it may be possible to encode an “open” random access point, after which all 
samples in output order can be correctly decoded, but some samples following the random access point 
in decoding order and preceding the random access point in output order need not be correctly 
decodable. For example, an intra picture starting an open group of pictures can be followed in decoding 
order by (bi- )predicted pictures that however precede the intra picture in output order; though they 
possibly cannot be correctly decoded if the decoding starts from the intra picture, they are not needed.  
Such “open” random-access samples can be marked by being a member of this group. Samples marked 
by  this  group  must  be  random  access  points,  and  may  also  be  sync  points  (i.e.  it  is  not  required  that 
samples marked by the sync sample table be excluded)." 
 
This text (which should probably be trimmed of its repeated sync sample definition) defines the 
concept "open" RAP that matches the concept of BLA_W_LP.  
 
14496-15 3rd edition specifies: 
"An  HEVC  sample  is  considered  as  a  sync  sample  if  the  VCL  NAL  units  in  the  sample  indicate  that  the  coded 
picture contained in the sample is an Instantaneous Decoding Refresh (IDR) picture, a Clean Random Access (CRA) 
picture, or a Broken Link Access (BLA) picture." 
 
The 14496-15 COR and defect report (N15183) also contain the same text. We believe this is an 
error. It should exclude CRA and BLA_W_LP. 
 
14496-15 defines a 'sync' sample group for providing the NALU type for sync samples. This is 
redundant with the SAP sample group. We propose to deprecate it. 
 
The DASH IF guidelines indicate: 
"IDR pictures with  nal_unit_type equal  to  IDR_N_LP and  IDR_W_RADL are mapped to  SAP 
types  1  and  2,  respectively.  BLA  pictures  with  nal_unit_type  equal  to  BLA_N_LP  and 
BLA_W_RADL  are  mapped  to  SAP  types  1  and  2,  respectively.  BLA  pictures  with 
nal_unit_type equal to BLA_W_LP are mapped to SAP type 2. CRA pictures with nal_unit_type 
equal to CRA_NUT are mapped to SAP type 3." 
 
We believe this is an error.  It should say that BLA_W_LP are mapped to SAP type 3. 
 
The DVB DASH specification indicates: 
 
"Note: The mapping to  SAP type 3 for ISO BMFF with HEVC deliberately remains undefined 
until  MPEG  reaches  a  conclusion.  This  includes  the  mapping  of  all  other  types  of  HEVC 
DVB_RAP  pictures  (including  BLA  pictures  with  nal_unit_type  equal  to  BLA_W_LP,  CRA 
pictures  with  nal_unit_type  equal  to  CRA_NUT  and  pictures  with  nal_unit_type  equal  to 
TRAIL_R  that  contain  only  slices  with  slice_type  equal  to  2  (I  slice),  as  specified  in  ETSI  TS 
101 154 [4] clause 5.14.1.8)." 
 

 

 

We believe DVB should be informed that MPEG reached a conclusion.

23008-12  defines  image  collection  and  image  sequences.  In  image  collection,  the  possible

profiles are not restricted. It is unclear if BLA or CRA pictures are allowed in image collection 
profiles. We propose to adopt the following:

4  Recommendation 
We  recommend  MPEG  to  update  14496-12,  14496-15  and  23008-12  to  harmonize  the 
definitions so that the mapping of HEVC IRAP pictures is clear and to liaise with DASH-IF and 
DVB.
