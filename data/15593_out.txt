Fixing the oinf box in the Layered HEVC file format

Introduction 

1 
The  current  text  requires  only  one  VPS  per  set  of  related  base  and  layer  tracks.  This  is 
unnecessarily  restrictive  as  there  are  several  use  cases  where  this  might  be  useful.  This 
contribution reviews some use cases and proposes a modification of the existing draft text. 

2  Analysis 
Some use cases are: 

-  Storage of spliced HEVC bitstreams with different VPS. 

 

-  Concatenating  files  obeying  to  the  same  profile  constraints.  Such  concatenation  could 

follow different strategies: 

o  Samples  in  tracks  containing  the  base  layers  from  both  files  could  simply  be 
concatenated, leading to  multiple VPS/SPS/PPS in different  sample entries or in 
larger hvcC NALU arrays. 

o  Sample from  non-base layers could  be concatenated by inspecting tracks one by 
one and concatenating them with sample from tracks corresponding to layers with 
similar  constraints,  if  any,  possibly  leading  to  a  change  in  time  of  the  (single) 
layer id associated to the track;  

o  Sample from the non-base layer tracks of the second file could be added to new 
sets  of tracks, shifted in time to  maintain sync with the concatenated base track. 
The  latter  approach  is  complex  and  might  not  be  preferable.  In  such  scenario,  it 
might be useful to allow for track-layer configuration changes. 

-  Streaming  a  long-running  fragmented  MP4  file  with  changes  in  layer  configuration.  In 
such case, a content producer defined two scalable layers for two classes of devices (e.g. 
SD, HD). After a period of time, a new class of device (e.g. UHD) is available. It should 
be  possible  to  reuse  the  two  tracks  and  to  add  an  extra  layer.  In  a  configuration  where 
movie  fragments  are  used,  the  operation  of  removing  fragments  should  not  lead  to 
information loss. If the layer configuration changed during the streaming this should be 
captured.  

 

 
 

 

 

Allowing information to change over time in the ISOBMFF can mean: using a dedicated track; 
using sample entries; or using sample groups. Using dedicated tracks allows sharing information 
across tracks. However, the precedent of AVC Parameter Sets tracks (signaled with 'avcp') does 
not  vote  for  this  option.  Using  sample  entries  in  regular  tracks  (ie.  for  HEVC  the  'hvcC'  box) 
does not  allow for modification after the  "moov" has been produced.  In a  context  of streaming 
layered  HEVC  using  movie  fragments,  this  does  not  seem  acceptable.  The  chosen  approach  is 
therefore to use sample groups. 

3  Proposal 
The layer configuration is currently provided by the 'oinf' and 'tcon' mandatory boxes.  
 
We  propose  to  move  those  boxes  out  of  the  'minf'  box  and  to  make  them  inherit  from  the 
VisualSampleGroupEntry class as below.  

class OperatingPointGroupEntry extends VisualSampleGroupEntry (‘oinf’) {  

 

// content of 'oinf' box 

} 
 
Usage of this new kind  of VisualSampleGroupEntry is the same as for any other sample group 
description  as  illustrated  below  (example  shows  two  sample  groups  resulting  from  stream 
splicing with different operating points): 

 
The default sample grouping mechanism can also be applied as shown below. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As well, since layer organization inside a track can vary along time, the ‘tcon’ box should follow 
the  same  transformation,  i.e.  moving  from  ‘minf’  box  to  a  new  grouping_type  and  new 
VisualSampleGroupEntry, for example LayerInfoGroupEntry ‘tcon’ as follows: 
  
class LayerInfoGroupEntry extends VisualSampleGroupEntry (‘tcon’) {  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
} 
 
For  a  track  with  constant  layer  organization,  the  default  sample  grouping  could  be  used  as 
follows (definition of a sample group description box with ‘tcon’ grouping_type): 

unsigned int (2) reserved; 
unsigned int (6) num_layers_in_track; 
for (i=0; i<num_layers_in_track; i++) { 
 
 
 
 
} 

unsigned int (4) reserved; 
unsigned int (6) layer_id; 
unsigned int (3) min_sub_layer_id; 
unsigned int (3) max_sub_layer_id; 

 

In case the layer organization varies along time, a sample group box can be defined to map 
samples to their appropriate layer to track organization: 

 

 

 
The current approach uses the ‘oref’ reference track type to signal which track contains the 'oinf' 
information. There are 2 options here: 

 

 

 

- discard the 'oref' type and mandate that the 'oinf' information be in the base track, as indicated 
by  the  'sbas'  track  reference.  In  case  of  hybrid  coding  (AVC  base  track  +  HEVC  enhancement 
track), this means that the sample group 'oinf' would be allowed on an AVC track. 
- if the first option is not possible, keep the 'oref' to signal which track contains the sample group 
and sample group description boxes indicating the 'oinf' information.  

4  Recommendation 
We propose to adopt the proposal in the FDIS of 14496-15 Amendment on Carriage of Layered 
HEVC.
