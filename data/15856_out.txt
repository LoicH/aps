DASH Editorial Clarifications

Introduction 

1 
This contribution discusses potential editorial issues in the DASH specification. 

Identifiers in template URLs  

2 
The specification states in 5.3.9.4.4: 
“This identifier is substituted with …” 

the correct wording should be « This identifier shall be substitued with …» 

3  $Time$ Identifier in template URLs  
The specification states in 5.3.9.4.4: 
“This identifier is substituted with the value of the SegmentTimeline@t attribute 
for the Segment being accessed.” 

It  is  not  clear  from  the  specification  that  an  segment  template  using  $Time$  with  no  segment 
timeline but only SegmentTemplate@duration is valid or not. 
 
Looking at 5.3.9.5.3, we can see that : 
“The time address is determined as follows:  

! if the Representation contains or inherits a SegmentTemplate element with $Time$ then the 
URL of the media segment at position k is determined by replacing the $Time$ identifier by 
MPD start time of this segment, as described below. ” 

Clause 5.3.9.4.4 should be fixed as follows : 

“This identifier is substituted with the value of the MPD start time of the Segment being 
accessed.” 

Moreover, formatting issues have appeared during the editing of 3rd edition. We suggest 
replacing  

“If the Representation contains or inherits a SegmentTemplate element with $Time$ then the 

 

 

URL of the media segment at position k is determined by replacing the $Time$ identifier by the 
time address associated to this Segment. The time address is determined as follows:  

! if the Representation contains or inherits a SegmentTemplate element with $Time$ then the 
URL of the media segment at position k is determined by replacing the $Time$ identifier by 
MPD start time of this segment, as described below.” 

with 

 “If the Representation contains or inherits a SegmentTemplate element with $Time$ then the 
URL of the media segment at position k is determined by replacing the $Time$ identifier by the 
MPD start time of this segment, as described below.” 

4  On switching in Annex A  
In A.6 the specification states 

« If @segmentAlignment is set true and the @startWithSAP is set to 1, 2 or 3 (and in the latter 
case the Representation@mediaStreamStructureId is identical for the two Representations), then 
the client may switch at any Segment boundary by just concatenating Segments with consecutive 
indices from different Representations. No overlap downloading and decoding is required. »  

This is not correct since this does not take into account @bitstreamSwitching properties. We 
suggest to reword as follows : 

« If @segmentAlignment is set true and the @startWithSAP is set to 1, 2 or 3 (and in the latter 
case the Representation@mediaStreamStructureId is identical for the two Representations), then 
the client may switch at any Segment boundary by  

- 

just concatenating Segments with consecutive indices from different Representations, if 
bitstreamSwitching flag is true on the parent adaptationSet.  

-  Loading the initialization segment or bitstream switching segment for the new 

Representation, before opening the new Segment. 

No overlap downloading and decoding is required. »  

 

5  Conclusion 
We suggest taking these edits into consideration for the next revision of DASH 3rd edition.
